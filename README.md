I made this project all by myself throught a challenge in the course ["Learn React for free"](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) from Scrimba, with Bob Ziroll. All I had to start working was a design from Figma and a link to the site that has the API consumed in the project.

I'm happy with the result. I think I learned a lot, as this is my first React project built where I didn't receive any kind of hint or code to work on.

The project comsumes API from (https://opentdb.com/) to get 5 random questions. Each question has a given number of answers, one of then being the correct one and the rest being incorrect. The user chooses one answer from each question and press the button to check how many questions were answered correctly.
